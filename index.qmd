## About Me

<br> I am a data scientist in AI/ ML/ GenAI, currently working as a Data Science Manager in SFL Scientific, a Deloitte business.

Prior to my career as a consultant, I got my PhD from Vanderbilt University, advised by <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/visepeople/benoit-dawant/" target="_blank">Prof. Benoit Dawant</a> and <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/visepeople/jack-noble/" target="_blank">Prof. Jack Noble</a>. I conducted research on medical image processing algorithms and statistical modeling to identify causes of poor health outcomes after surgery. Read my full <a href="https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/bitstream/handle/1803/16636/CHAKRAVORTI-DISSERTATION-2021.pdf"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dissertation</a> for more info!

When I'm not trying to find patterns in data, I love to travel and hike. Getting out in nature is one of my favorite ways to spend a long weekend! On weekdays after work I can be generally found training in taekwondo.


Here's a list of my [publications](papers) and my [CV](cv.pdf).
