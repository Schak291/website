## Bio

<img src="/docs/assets/img/IMG_0480.png" alt="Kiholo Bay" width=500 align=center>

<br><b> At Kiholo Bay, Island of Hawai'i</b>

<br> Hello! I am a data science consultant in AI. I use machine learning and data science to solve both business and research problems in the energy, resources and industrial products sectors. Currently I am a Data Science Manager in SFL Scientific, a Deloitte business.

Prior to joining industry, I got a PhD from Vanderbilt University, advised by Prof Benoit Dawant and Prof Jack Noble. I conducted research on medical image processing algorithms and statistical modeling to identify causes of poor health outcomes after surgery.

<b> When I'm not trying to find patterns in data,</b> I love to travel and hike. The photo above is when I went to Hawai'i for the first time and was stunned at the effortless beauty of the land.
