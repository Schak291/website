## Bio

<br> I am a data scientist in AI and GenAI. I use data science to solve both business and research problems in the healthcare and retail goods sectors. Currently I am a Data Science Manager in SFL Scientific, a Deloitte business.

Prior to working as a consultant, I got my PhD from Vanderbilt University, advised by Prof Benoit Dawant and Prof Jack Noble. I conducted research on medical image processing algorithms and statistical modeling to identify causes of poor health outcomes after surgery. Read my full <a href="https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/bitstream/handle/1803/16636/CHAKRAVORTI-DISSERTATION-2021.pdf"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dissertation</a> for more info!

When I'm not trying to find patterns in data, I love to travel and hike. Getting out in nature is one of my favorite ways to spend a long weekend! On weekdays after work I can be generally found training in taekwondo.


Here's a list of my [publications](papers) and my [CV](cv.pdf).
